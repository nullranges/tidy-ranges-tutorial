We provide examples of computing operations on genomic ranges using the
[tidy data philosophy](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/tidy-data.html).

You can find the preview of this example at 
<https://nullranges.github.io/tidy-ranges-tutorial>

What we plan to build out:

* simple example of computing overlaps with *plyranges*, with one or
  more sets of comparison features
* simple example of comparison of overlap with null features, either
  using matching or bootstrapping with *nullranges*
* comparing across different parameter settings in *nullranges*
* example of using *nullranges* in combination with *BiocParallel*
* example of computing more complex operations than overlaps,
  e.g. correlations of expression values
